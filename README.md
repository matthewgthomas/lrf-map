# Make a map of all Local Resilience Forums (and their devolved equivalents) in the UK

Run `create boundaries.r` to create high-resolution and low-resolution shapefiles and geojsons for all Local Resilience Forums, Local Resilience Partnerships, and Emergency Preparedness Groups in the UK.

The script requires these R packages:

- `tidyverse`
- `sf`
- `rmapshaper`
